#TODO
-	{DONE} Signal watcher -> When for example the application needs closing, we want to look for SIGINT
-	{DONE} FD Watcher with callback to handler class -> OnFDRead and OnFDWrite
-	{DONE} Timer structure -> Every cycle of the loop we need to check if a timer has expired
-	{DONE} Cycle stats -> See how many cycles have been ran every second
-	{DONE} Have option for choosing between normal timer and linux timerfd -> this would mean that users would have a choice between "run-hot" and waiting for timerfd -> no timerfd, just timeout value on the epoll call
-	{DONE} Latency class on callback classes -> Not all classes have to be called every cycle, high latency callback should be either 1000 cycles or be specifiable
-	{DONE} Have callback scheduled for next cycle -> give options for function to be executed on the next cycle
	-	OnFdWrite() for scheduling write on socket for next cycle
		-	Right now implemented using oneshot timer, check this for more clean approach
-	{DONE} Stats output should include timer for measuring in between prints

-	UDP socket
	-	Can lift from streamsocket
-	Threadpool
	-	Jobs get announced to the eventloop, upon each cycle jobs get distributed to the pool
-	Have amount of polls done on fd's outputed by stats
	-	Should be #fd's in watchlist * #cycles
-	Settings file
	-	Users need to be able to define config file options for their application
	-	TOML files seem like the easiest to setup and define
-	Async db library
	-	SQLite
	-	PostgresQL
-	Low-latency websockets
	-	Websockets see an increase in usage accros the web, need way to quickly respond
-	InfluxDB writer
